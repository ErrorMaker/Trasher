# Room Trasher
Extension built to trash habbo rooms. First you click activate, check mark furni, and click start. There is more options on there as well!

1. Paste the 1 dll in zip in the dependencies folder of tanji.
2. Install the exe in tanji modules.
3. Open the extension
4. Click Activate
5. Select floor (Check Mark Floor)
6. Click START to move everything everywhere (Make sure you reload room before you start it)
OR
7. Check get tile and move to coord then click start (Make sure you reload room before you start it)
8. Now click places where you want furni to be moved (This only works good for stackable items)
9. I suggest just to ONLY check mark Floor and click start and trash the room!

If you need help using this extension please message me on discord Ahmed#8333
