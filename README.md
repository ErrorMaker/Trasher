# Room Trasher
Extension built to trash habbo rooms. First you click activate, check mark furni, and click start. There is more options on there as well! Most important is there is 1 .dll folders in the ZIP. You must download the zip and extract it. Put the 1 .dll in the Dependencies folder (Unless you already have it) and then install the .exe on tanji. If you need help using this extension please message me on discord Ahmed#8333
